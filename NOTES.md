Capturing these two methods of interaction from the README and moving them here:

### Stop & Jot
There's a ton of information we could record about the weather. Yet when you
read the weather report in the morning, all of that information is distilled
down to a handful of numbers: 34 degrees fahrenheit, 20% chance of
precipitation, 4 degree windchill...

Why do you think that might be?

When you take something complex and then hide that complexity under a more simple interface, you are using a technique called **abstraction**. 

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)): In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is a technique for arranging complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level.

### Think-Pair-Share

<summary>How might abstraction be relevant as software developers? Take a
minute and discuss this with your squad.</summary>

We can use abstraction to represent real-world entities when we write software. This allows us to hide complex systems underneath easy to grasp objects and models.
